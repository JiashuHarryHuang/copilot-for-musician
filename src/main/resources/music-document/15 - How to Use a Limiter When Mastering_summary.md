# Summary for 15 - How to Use a Limiter When Mastering.pdf


## Page 1
This document page provides a step-by-step guide on how to use a limiter effectively when mastering audio. The guide is presented by "Musician On A Mission" and includes both visual and textual instructions.

### Visual Overview:
The top section of the page features a graphical representation of a limiter's settings, showing input, reduction, and output levels. Key parameters are displayed:
- **Input Level**: 2.5 dB
- **Reduction**: -0.5 dB
- **Output Level**: -0.5 dB

The graphical interface also shows the following controls:
- **Output Level**: Set at -0.5 dBFS
- **Gain**: +17.0 dB
- **Attack**: 100.0 ms
- **Release**: 500.0 ms

### Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. **Add the limiter as the last plugin in your chain.**
2. **Set the output ceiling at -0.5 dBFS.**
3. **Increase your input gain until you're getting about 10 dBs of gain reduction.**
4. **Set your attack very slow (100 ms).**
5. **Set your release very slow (500 ms).**
6. **Decrease the attack as much as possible until you hear the mix start to lose impact, then back off a bit.**
7. **Decrease the release as much as possible until you begin to hear your mix distorting, then back off a bit. You could also use the auto function to let the compressor do it for you.**
8. **Decrease your input gain until you're getting 2â€“3 dBs of gain reduction.**

### Summary:
The document outlines a comprehensive process for using a limiter during the mastering stage of audio production. It emphasizes setting the limiter as the final plugin in the chain, adjusting key parameters like output level, gain, attack, and release to achieve optimal results. The goal is to maximize the loudness of the audio while maintaining clarity and preventing distortion. The guide also suggests using an auto function to assist with some of the adjustments, ensuring that the process is efficient and effective.
