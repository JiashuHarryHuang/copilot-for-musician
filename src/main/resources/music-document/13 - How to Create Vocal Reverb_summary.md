# Summary for 13 - How to Create Vocal Reverb.pdf


## Page 1
This document page provides a step-by-step guide on how to create vocal reverb, which is a technique used to add a sense of space around the vocal in a mix. The goal is to achieve a more natural and less up-front vocal sound. Here’s a summary of the content:

### Overview:
- **Purpose**: To create a sense of space around the vocal using reverb.
- **Type of Reverb**: The guide focuses on different types of reverb such as plate, room, hall, chamber, and plate.

### Steps to Create Vocal Reverb:

#### Step 1: Setting Up the Auxiliary Track
1. **Create an Aux Track**: Use an aux track to apply reverb to your vocal.
2. **Send Your Vocal to the Aux Track**: Route your vocal signal to this aux track.

#### Step 2: Configuring the Reverb
1. **Set Reverb to 100% Wet**: Ensure that the reverb is fully wetted to the vocal.
2. **Try Different Reverb Types**: Experiment with various reverb types (room, hall, chamber, or plate) and choose the one you prefer.
3. **Adjust Reverb Time**: Set the reverb time to 4 seconds initially, then adjust it down until it sounds natural with the rest of the mix. A shorter reverb time (0.5–1.5 seconds) is often recommended for vocals.
4. **Increase Pre-Delay**: Adjust the pre-delay until the vocal stands out from the reverb. A pre-delay of 30–100 ms is typically effective.
5. **Adjust Distance/Early/Late Reflections**: Fine-tune the distance or early/late reflections to taste. Further distance or more late reflections will make the vocal sound lusher but can push it back in the mix.

### Visual Elements:
- **Reverb Parameters**: The document includes visual representations of reverb parameters such as pre-delay, decay time, reflections, distance, and balance.
- **Control Panel**: A diagram shows how to route signals through an audio interface, including the use of buses and auxiliary tracks.

### Pro Tips:
- **Shorter Reverb Times**: Shorter reverb times work best for vocals, usually between 0.5–1.5 seconds.
- **Pre-Delay Adjustment**: A pre-delay of 30–100 ms is generally good for balancing the vocal with the reverb.
- **Distance/Reflections**: Further distance or more late reflections will make the vocal sound lusher but can push it back in the mix.

### Summary:
The document provides a comprehensive guide on creating vocal reverb, detailing the setup process, parameter adjustments, and tips for achieving the desired effect. It aims to help musicians create a more natural and balanced vocal sound by adding a sense of space around the vocal using reverb.

This document page from "Musician on a Mission" provides a step-by-step guide on how to create vocal reverb in a music production setup. The content is divided into two main steps:

**Step 3: EQ**
1. **Put an EQ before the reverb.**
2. **Move a high pass filter up until the mix starts to sound too thin.**
3. **Listen to your vocal. If it's too dark or too bright, adjust the highs:**
   - Boost the highs with a shelf if it's too dark.
   - Cut the highs if it's too bright.
4. **If the reverb is making your vocal too muddy, cut 3-10 dBs in the low mids.**

**Step 4: Volume**
1. **Turn the volume of the aux track all the way down.**
2. **Then turn it up slowly until it sounds nice to your ears.**
3. **Finally, turn it back down a few dBs for safety.**

The page also includes a visual representation of an equalizer curve at the top, showing frequency ranges and their corresponding adjustments, and a diagram illustrating the signal flow through a mixing console with labels for "Bus 1," "EQ," "Reverb," and "Stereo Out." There is also a graphic of a volume meter indicating the adjustment process for the reverb level.
