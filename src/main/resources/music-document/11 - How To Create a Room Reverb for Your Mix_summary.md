# Summary for 11 - How To Create a Room Reverb for Your Mix.pdf


## Page 1
This document page from "Musician on a Mission" provides a guide on how to create room reverb for your audio mix. It explains the concept of reverb, its importance in music production, and the steps to set up and configure reverb effects.

### What is Reverb?
Reverb is the sound of the room. When added to an instrument, it makes the instrument sound like it's in a new space.

### Why Should I Use Reverb?
1. To push things back in the mix.
2. To control the tone of the mix.

### How to Create a Room Reverb for Your Mix

#### Step 1: Create Two Aux Channels
- Label one channel "Ambience" and the other "Room Tone."
- Place a reverb plugin on each aux channel.

#### Step 2: Set Up Your Two Channels

##### Ambience
- **Reverb Type**: Room
- **Balance**: 100% wet
- **Decay Time**: 250–750 ms
- **Pre-delay**: 2–25 ms
- **Reflections**: More early, less late
- **Distance**: 1–5%

##### Room Tone
- **Reverb Type**: Room, hall, or chamber
- **Balance**: 100% wet
- **Decay Time**: 500–3000 ms
- **Pre-delay**: 0–75 ms
- **Reflections**: Less early, more late
- **Distance**: 15–50%

The document uses visual aids, such as diagrams of audio channels with reverb controls, to illustrate the setup process. It also provides specific parameter settings for each channel to achieve the desired room reverb effect in a mix.

This document page provides a step-by-step guide on how to create room reverb for your music mix. Here is a summary of the content:

1. **Step 3: Send Instruments to Aux Channels**
   - **Objective**: Adjust the balance of instruments in the mix using two aux channels: Ambience and Room Tone.
   - **Instructions**:
     - To push an instrument back in the mix, send more of it to the Ambience channel.
     - To make an instrument have noticeable reverb, send more of it to the Room Tone channel.
   - **Visuals**: Diagrams showing three audio tracks (Vocals, Guitar, Drums) with sliders for Bus 1 and Bus 2, indicating how to route signals to these channels.

2. **Step 4: Apply EQ Before Reverbs**
   - **Objective**: Optimize the sound by adjusting the equalization before applying reverb.
   - **Instructions**:
     - Move a high-pass filter up until the mix starts to sound too thin.
     - Listen to the overall mix and adjust the top end of the reverb with a shelf if needed.
     - If the mix sounds too bright, try cutting with a shelf instead.
     - If the reverb makes the mix sound muddy, try cutting 3-10 dBs in the low mids.
   - **Visuals**: A graph illustrating an equalization curve.

3. **Step 5: Balance the Volume in Your Mix**
   - **Objective**: Ensure that the reverb effects are balanced and do not overpower the mix.
   - **Instructions**:
     - Turn the volume of the aux tracks all the way down.
     - Slowly turn them up until they sound nice to your ears.
     - Then turn them back down 1-3 dBs for safety.
   - **Visuals**: Diagrams showing two aux channels (Bus 1 and Bus 2) with sliders for EQ and Reverb, and arrows indicating the process of balancing volumes.

The document aims to help musicians understand and apply these techniques effectively to enhance their music mixes with appropriate reverb effects.
