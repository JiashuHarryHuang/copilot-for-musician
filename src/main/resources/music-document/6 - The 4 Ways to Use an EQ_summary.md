# Summary for 6 - The 4 Ways to Use an EQ.pdf


## Page 1
This document page provides a guide on how to effectively use an equalizer (EQ) in music production, offering four key strategies:

1. **Remove the Gross Stuff**:
   - Use narrow cuts to remove unwanted "room resonances."
   - Employ an EQ sweep to identify and address problematic frequencies.
   - Boost a bell filter with a Q of 15 and move it slowly from left to right to target specific areas.
   - Cut out small areas that sound "nasty" or are too loud.
   - Use a high-pass filter to remove low-end noise, but only when necessary.

2. **Enhance the Good Stuff**:
   - Utilize wider cuts and boosts (0.1-2.0 Q) to shape the tone.
   - Perform an EQ sweep to find areas that sound good and boost them, starting with around 3dB and adjusting as needed.
   - If areas sound overpowering, cut them, starting with around 3dB and tweaking to taste.

3. **Make Things Sound Different**:
   - Filter the lows and highs and boost the mids to create a classic megaphone sound on vocals.

4. **Create Space in the Mix**:
   - Carve out space in the spectrum of certain instruments to make room for other, more important instruments.
   - For example, try cutting around 4 kHz in your acoustic guitar to make space for your vocals.

Each section includes visual aids in the form of frequency response graphs to illustrate the concepts being discussed.
