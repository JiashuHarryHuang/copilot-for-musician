# Summary for 12 - How to Create Vocal Delay.pdf


## Page 1
This document page provides a step-by-step guide on how to create vocal delay using audio processing techniques, aimed at enhancing the sound of vocals by adding a sense of space and depth. The guide is designed for musicians looking to achieve an exciting, up-front vocal sound.

### Key Points:

1. **Purpose**: 
   - The primary goal is to create a sense of space around the vocal, making it more prominent and engaging in the mix.

2. **Setup**:
   - **Step 1 (AUX)**: 
     - Create an auxiliary (aux) track to route your stereo delay.
     - Send your vocal signal to this aux track.
   - **Step 2 (DELAY)**:
     - Set the delay to 100% wet, meaning the delayed signal will be fully mixed with the original signal.
     - Unlink the left and right channels of the delay effect.
     - Set one side of the delay to a delay time between 50-200 milliseconds.
     - Set the other side to a delay time between 20-50 milliseconds behind the first side.
     - **Pro Tip**: The longer the delay time, the more noticeable the delay effect will be.
     - **Pro Tip**: The farther apart the second channel is set, the wider the vocal will sound.
     - Adjust the feedback level to between 0-15%, depending on how natural you want the delay to sound.

3. **Visual Representation**:
   - The document includes visual representations of the delay settings:
     - **Left Delay**: Delay Time = 75.0 ms, Feedback = 5%
     - **Right Delay**: Delay Time = 100 ms, Feedback = 5%
     - **Output Mix**: Left and Right are both set to 100%

4. **Stereo Link**:
   - There is an option to link the left and right channels, which can be toggled as needed.

5. **Overall Process**:
   - The process involves creating a separate aux track for the delay effect, sending the vocal to this track, and then adjusting the delay settings to achieve the desired effect.

This guide is useful for producers and musicians who want to enhance their vocal tracks by adding depth and spatial effects through the use of delay.

This music document page provides a step-by-step guide on how to create vocal delay, as part of the "Musician on a Mission" series. The content is divided into two main steps:

### Step 3: EQ
1. **Put an EQ before the delay.**
2. **Move a low filter up until the mix starts to sound too thin.** (Pro Tip: Try not to cut higher than 300 Hz.)
3. **Move a high filter down until the delay gets too lost in the sound of the vocal.** (Pro Tip: Try not to cut lower than 3 kHz.)

### Step 4: Volume
1. **Turn the volume of the aux track all the way down.**
2. **Then turn it up slowly until it sounds nice to your ears.**
3. **Finally, turn it down a few dBs for safety.**

The page also includes a visual representation of an equalizer curve at the top, showing a boost around 500 Hz and a cut above 10 kHz. Additionally, there is a diagram illustrating the signal flow through a mixing console, with labels for "Bus 1," "EQ," "Stereo Delay," and "Stereo Out." A volume control slider is shown at the bottom, labeled "Delay," indicating the adjustment process for the auxiliary track's volume.

Overall, the document aims to guide musicians through the technical aspects of adding vocal delay to their recordings, focusing on proper equalization and volume management.
